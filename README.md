Abstract: In this era of data-driven governance and policy-design, officials need to generate insights from massive amounts of data posted/reported online. However, finding relevant data for policy design/assessment is challenging owing to the volume, variety, and verasity of the data across  societal topics, spaces, and places. Existing solutions tend to predominately focus on analyzing online social network data, news articles, blogs, and other crowd-sourced platforms. Project City Optics crawls and analyses textual data from the GDELTâ€™s Quotation Graph which compiles quoted statements in worldwide news coverage. Quotations is an overlooked data source that can provide more authentic, credible and reliable information. City Optics employs  real time Machine Learning pipelines to crawl data, identify sentiment, locations, and named entities within and across quotations, and subsequently visualize the data through Kibana dashboard. Furthermore, it also enables an immersive VR display.
